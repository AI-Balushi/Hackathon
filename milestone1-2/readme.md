# Milestone 2: Publish on GitHub and Host on Vercel

## Objective
The goal of Milestone 2 is to take the static resume created in Milestone 1, push the project to GitHub, and deploy it on Vercel. This milestone focuses on demonstrating proficiency in version control and deployment processes, ensuring that the resume is accessible online and the repository is well-organized.

## Requirements
1. **GitHub Repository**: 
   - **Push the Project Code**: Upload the entire project code to a new GitHub repository.
   - **Repository Organization**: Ensure that the repository is well-structured with clear folder organization and appropriate file naming conventions to enhance code readability and maintainability.

2. **Vercel Deployment**: 
   - **Deploy the Project**: Use Vercel to deploy the project, making the resume publicly accessible via a live URL.
   - **Verify Accessibility**: Ensure that the deployed resume is fully functional and correctly displayed when accessed through the provided URL.

## Scoring Breakdown
- **GitHub Repository Setup and Organization (50 points)**:
  - Code must be properly committed and pushed to GitHub.
  - Repository should have a logical folder structure and follow best practices for file naming and organization.

- **Successful Deployment on Vercel (50 points)**:
  - The resume should be successfully deployed and publicly accessible via Vercel.
  - Verify that the resume displays correctly and functions as intended on the live URL.
